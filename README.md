# Learn-Rust
# This is not a tutorial for learning rust programming language!
It's just a journal to record my steps toward a Rust Master.
I'd like to share some tips about rust programming with anyone who loves rust too
Due to my poor git skill,the update of this repository will be fluent and won't leave any old versions.
I think the final code would be a graph engine(?).
By the way ,I 'm learning struct now :-)
